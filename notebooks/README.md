# Notebooks

All notebooks found here contain Zeppelin notebooks in JSON format that can be [imported into any SKIL experiment](https://docs.skymind.ai/docs/conducting-experiments).

- [Training & deploying Keras and DL4J models in the same notebook](https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL_Examples/blob/master/notebooks/end_to_end.json): In this end-to-end example you'll see how to mix and match several deep learning frameworks (and programming languages) in the same Zeppelin notebook. (_Python & Scala_)
- [Importing a Keras model and training it on Spark](https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL_Examples/blob/master/notebooks/scala_spark_training.json): This example will show you how to take a Keras model of your choice, import it into DL4J in one line of code, wrap it into a Spark model and do distributed training with it. (_Python & Scala_)
- [Keras model deployment](https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL_Examples/blob/master/notebooks/python_keras_tf_mnist.json): Deploy a simple Keras model from the SKIL UI. (_Python_)
- [TensorFlow model deployment](https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL_Examples/blob/master/notebooks/python_tf_mnist.json): Deploy a TensorFlow model with SKIL. (_Python_)
- [Deploying a KNN model](https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL_Examples/blob/master/notebooks/scala_knn_smile_test.json): An example showing you how to deploy a K-nearest-neighbor model with SKIL. (_Scala_)
- [Running a Spark training job with SKIL]((https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL_Examples/blob/master/notebooks/spark_example.json): This notebook shows you how to scale-out your DL4J deep learning model on Apache Spark. (_Scala_)
- [UCI sequence classification example](https://github.com/SkymindIO/SKIL_Examples/blob/master/notebooks/uci_quickstart_notebook.json): The notebook corresponding to the above listed sequence classification example. (_Scala_)
