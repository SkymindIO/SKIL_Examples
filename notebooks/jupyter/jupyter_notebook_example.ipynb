    "## SKIL Clients\n",
    "This notebook tutorial demonstrate how to leverage SKIL from an external system (a raw Jupyter Notebook, in this case) using [skil-clients](https://github.com/SkymindIO/skil-clients).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting a Jupyter Server\n",
    "You can start a Jupyter server in either of the two following ways:\n",
    "## [Method - 1]  Starting a Jupyter Server in SKIL \n",
    "\n",
    "SKIL v1.1 and later comes pre-bundled with a jupyter notebook package. You can start a Jupyter server by running the following script in a Zeppelin notebook's paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "%sh\n",
    "nohup /opt/skil/miniconda/bin/jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --notebook-dir='~' &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you the link to connect to the Jupyter server. If you get a connection string similar to the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://ffasdawfga:8888/?token=135a1ced8a4fd35790d932f0f23fbb0ad8484374f3aa97a2\n",
    "```\n",
    "then make sure you change the **host** part to either `0.0.0.0` or `localhost` or the **domain name/ip address of your server**. So, the connection string would look something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=135a1ced8a4fd35790d932f0f23fbb0ad8484374f3aa97a2\n",
    "OR\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=135a1ced8a4fd35790d932f0f23fbb0ad8484374f3aa97a2\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you're running SKIL through the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/skymindops/skil-ce/), make sure you add additional port forwards using `-p 8888:8888` and `-p 9100:9100` to the `docker run` command to access the Jupyter instance in your browser and the model history server endpoints, respectively. So, your docker command could look something like this: \n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run --rm -it -p 9008:9008 -p 8080:8080 -p 9100:9100 -p 8888:8888 skymindops/skil-ce bash /start-skil.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Method - 2] Starting a Jupyter Server externally\n",
    "If you want to install Jupyter in another machine then you can follow this guide [here](http://jupyter.org/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've started the Jupyter server successfully, you can import/upload this notebook to it and start working on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "This tutorial will target the following features of SKIL:\n",
    "1. Upload a trained model to the SKIL server\n",
    "2. Utilize the [skil-clients](https://github.com/SkymindIO/skil-clients) API ([Python](https://github.com/SkymindIO/skil-clients/tree/master/python) version) \n",
    "3. Utilize the \"Model History Server\" API (from skil-clients) to:\n",
    "    - Create workspaces,\n",
    "    - Create experiments\n",
    "    - Adding models\n",
    "    - Adding evaluations\n",
    "    - Adding minibatches\n",
    "    - Adding examples\n",
    "    - Calculating evaluations through the model feedback endpoint\n",
    "4. Utilize the \"Deployments\" API (from skil-clients) to:\n",
    "    - Deploy a model\n",
    "    - Start a model to serve.\n",
    "5. Utilize the \"Predictions\" API (from skil-clients) to:\n",
    "    - Classify an image\n",
    "    \n",
    "We'll install TensorFlow to train a basic MNIST model. Then we'll upload that model to the SKIL server. Later on we'll add the model into an experiment in a workspace and then add evaluations to it based on the training and test results obtain through the TensorFlow model. "
